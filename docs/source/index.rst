Welcome to FakerNet's documentation!
====================================

FakerNet is a framework to quickly build internet-like services rapidly for home labs, testing, and research. Instead of wasting time setting up DNS, web servers, certificate authorities, and email, FakerNet uses Docker and LXC to quickly spin up these services and servers without all the hassle.
