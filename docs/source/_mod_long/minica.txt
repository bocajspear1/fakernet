MiniCA is a small, Go-based CA web application used to generate certificates for FakerNet services. It has a single password as its authentication, so don't use this in any production system or untrusted network.

The password for creating certs is located in ``work/minica/<SERVER_ID>/ca.pass`` externally or ``/etc/minica/certs/ca.pass`` in the container.

The web interface is available as HTTPS (signed by itself) at the container's IP address. You'll need to upload a CSR and enter the CA password.

Source for the CA server is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/bocajspear1/minica>`_.
