This module allows management of iptables rules from FakerNet. These rules will always be added when FakerNet starts. This makes it useful for setting up things like NAT. 

..  warning::

    Rules are always added at the top. Use the ``list_order`` to get a better idea of the order the rules will be added.

.. warning:: 
    
    Rules are not removed when FakerNet stops

.. note::

    ``!`` can be used in ``add_nat_allow`` to do a "not" of the range
