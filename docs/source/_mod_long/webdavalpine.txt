This module creates a Apache-based WebDAV server on an Alpine Linux instance. Public files are accessed at ``<SERVER>/files/public`` while other paths require credentials. A ``admin`` user is created on build and their password is located in the ``webdav`` subdirectory in the server's working directory. For example, with server with an ID of 1: ``work/webdavalpine/1/webdav/admin.pass``
